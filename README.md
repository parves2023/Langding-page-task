## üí° Notes

* The entire slider functionality was implemented manually for greater customization and control over transitions.
* Tailwind‚Äôs utility-first approach helped ensure responsive design without writing custom media queries.
* Consider extending this landing page with route navigation, form handling, or CMS integration (like Sanity or Strapi) for a full website experience.
